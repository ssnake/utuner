Background

I'm owner of AverMedia AVerTV Volar AX tuner which has fine software. But the major disappointment about it is bad channel control. Once you scanned channels and if new channels appeared you have to scan whole frequency scale and it wipes the names of channel etc. Also you couldn't control channel order in the list. So it annoyed me and I decided to write my own tuner application which should make things easier and simpler.
